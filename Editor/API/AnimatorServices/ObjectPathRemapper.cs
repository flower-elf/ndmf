    ///     The ObjectPathRemapper is used to track GameObject movement in the hierarchy, and to update animation paths
    ///     accordingly.
    ///     While the ObjectPathRemapper is active, there are a few important rules around hierarchy and animation
    ///     maniuplation that must be observed.
    ///     1. The ObjectPathRemapper takes a snapshot of the object paths that were present at time of activation;
    ///     as such, any new animations added while it is active must use those paths, not those of the current
    ///     hierarchy. To help with this, you can use the `GetVirtualPathForObject` method to get the path that
    ///     should be used for newly generated animations.
    ///     2. Objects can be moved freely within the hierarchy; however, if you want to _remove_ an object, you must call
    ///     `ReplaceObject` on it first.
    ///     3. Objects can be freely added; if you want to use those objects in animations, use `GetVirtualPathForObject`
    ///     to get the path that should be used. This will automatically register that object, if necessary. If you'd
    ///     like to use animation clips with pre-existing paths on, for example, a newly instantiated prefab hierarchy,
    ///     use `RecordObjectTree` to ensure that those objects have their current paths recorded first. This ensures
    ///     that if those objects are moved in later stages, the paths will be updated appropriately.
    ///     Note that it's possible that these paths may collide with paths that _previously_ existed, so it's still
    ///     recommended to use `GetVirtualPathForObject` to ensure that the path is unique.
